# Building wavefile-reader

Building works the same on all platforms:
```
npm run build
```
This will lint the sources, test the sources, compile the dist files, test everything and generate API documentation.

There **should** be no errors or warnings during the build.

The dist files are generated in the *dist/* folder.

The API documentation is generated in the *docs/* folder.
